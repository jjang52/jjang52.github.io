I am a postdoc fellow in the School of Engineering and Applied Science at Harvard University. I received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in the School of Electrical Engineering from Korea University in Feb. 2011 and Feb. 2018, respectively. My research interests are computer vision and connectomics, espeically in the problems of segmentation using deep learning.
