This course aims to help students understand political science research and produce your own research. Throughout the course, we discuss four questions: (1) what is the concept of “political science,” rather than “politics”? (2) what kind of research do political scientists do? (3) how do political scientists conduct their scientific studies and communicate the knowledge to one another? (4) which methodology is the best fit to the research? Throughout this course, we critically examine these questions. We do not focus on a specific field such as American Politics, Comparative Politics, or International Relations. Instead, we are interested in understanding the methods that political scientists in all fields use to build knowledge. As such, this course enables you to better understand the literature you read in substantive courses and helps you to conduct your own scientific research on the topics you are interested in. In our lab session (once in a week), we learn how to use the statistical software, STATA and the Geographic Information System software, ArcGIS.
