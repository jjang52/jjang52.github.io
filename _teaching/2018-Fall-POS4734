This course aims to help students understand the dynamics of international conflict and conduct their own scientific research. Throughout the course, we discuss four questions: (1) what is the concept of the scientific study of international conflict? (2) how to conduct scientific study? (3) which causal factor contributes to the initiation, escalation, and termination of international conflict? (4) which methodology is the best fit to study international conflict? We also critically examine the various causes and correlates of international conflict from different level of analysis as well as the outcomes and consequences of war. We evaluate the different methodologies (from statistical analysis to in-depth case studies) and have an opportunity to analyze statistical data used in current literature via STATA.
